/**
 * React hook for getting current leaflet [map](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#map). Returns the same value as the `map` member of the `leaflet` prop when using [withLeaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/en/context.html) HOC from react-lealfet [module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-leaflet).
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import React from "react"
 * import { Map } from "react-leaflet"
 * import { useLeafletMap } from "use-leaflet"
 *
 * const MyLeafletComponent = (props) => {
 *   const map = useLeafletMap()
 *   return (
 *     <... onClick={() => map.fitBounds(turf.bbox(props.activeShape))}>
 *       ...
 *     </...>
 *   )
 * }
 *
 * const App = () => (
 *   <Map>
 *     <MyLeafletComponent />
 *   </Map>
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind, that `useLeafletMap` hook will work only in components which are used within [Map](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/en/components.html#map) component, the same as `withLeaflet` HOC from `react-leaflet`.
 *
 * @returns current leaflet map.
